This project compares the performance of transformer models and simpler neural network models on two tasks using the New York Times article dataset. 
The first task is classification of the tone of the articles using the headline, abstract, and keywords as input features. 
The second task is regression to predict the number of comments an article will receive using the topic, tone, length, hour of the day, 
and day of the week as input features. We compare the results of transformer models and the simpler models for both tasks.
