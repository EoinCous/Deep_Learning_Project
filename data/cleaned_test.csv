And this lack of trust has led to a renewed examination of the nation’s voting equipment.","['Voting Machines', 'Elections', 'Presidential Election of 2020', 'Texas', 'Austin (Tex)', 'Cyberattacks and Hackers', 'Cyberwarfare and Defense', 'Presidential Election of 2016', 'Russian Interference in 2016 US Elections and Ties to Trump Associates']",0,0,"38,59,2,25,3887,27,150,1480,19,1864,2,301,25,27,53,4,549,21909,9,162,719,2646,491,720,6,98,162,822,11204,14,144,2293,3,2,198,8,2794,1,11381,27,1935,649,215,1232,2,6460,20567,3,39,2,6343,412,109,43,2495,125,1886,22,64,1694,6754,141,598,64,33,593,5,6884,2,3039,3,129,207,22,60,1686,59,43,3720,28,64,2244,168,128,375,8042,78,151,9787,9,2,14,29,142,1,41,2360,3,1754,34,1045,5,4,5103,7034,3,2,516,8,162,1223,162,2191,180,30,27,3,21,575,2073,957,2788,1,2289,1480,1,143,30,27,3,301,491,720,6,301,25,180,1,626,5,11,724",857,0.054626961,2020-10-18 20:00:11+00:00,6,20,
